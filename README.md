## Overview

Xaraya uses extensions, also known as modules or themes, that each have
a unique ID to identify them by. This unique ID is not only used in the
Xaraya codebase itself, but also used to track and aggregate
documentation, releases, information and activities that are related to
a specific Extenstion.

The release module is Xaraya.com's tool of tracking module and theme
information. It does this by:

1.  **Tracking Module and Theme ID's**
    
    You can view all Registered Extensions in the [Extension List View
    Page'](#$extlisturl#).You can also [register your own
    extensions](#$extregisterurl#) with the link from that page.

2.  **Tracking Version Release and History of Modules and Themes**
    
    Extensions that have already been release can be viewed on the
    [Recent Extension Release page](#$extreleaseurl#).

3.  **Providing Extension IDs for Documentation of Modules and Themes**
    
    Xaraya Extension Documentation is linked directly to a relevant
    extension via the Extension ID on any relevant document. You can
    view specific Extension documentation for Extension API References,
    Admin Extension Guides or the Theme Reference areas of the
    xaraya.com site.
